# Frigate Viewer

This is mobile application which has been written using React Native to easily browse camera events of Frigate NVR. This is not official app.

## Android developing

Follow the instructions of React Native docs to install Android Studio and the emulator.

Run `npm install` to install dependencies and `npm run android` to start the emulator, compile the app and install it on the emulator or a connected device.

## iOS developing

I've never run this application on iOS. It should work in theory, but probably needs some enhancements.
